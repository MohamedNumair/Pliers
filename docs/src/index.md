# Pliers.jl Documentation

## Overview

Pliers.jl is a collection of tools that I usually need (like pliers for an electrician) for analyzing power distribution systems. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the [PowerModelsDistribution.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsDistribution.jl) or [PowerModelsDistributionStateEstimation.jl](https://github.com/Electa-Git/PowerModelsDistributionStateEstimation.jl) packages for simplified reporting, analysis and visualization.

## Installation

Currently Pliers is still under development and not registered. You can install it by cloning the repository and adding it to your Julia environment:

```julia
dev
