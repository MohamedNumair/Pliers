For the `basic-circuits` project, the following tasks are pending:

Inspired by [EE-fundamentals notebooks](https://github.com/bingsen-wang/EE-Fundamentals) by Bingsen Wang, a series of circuit elements modelling in Julia can be established visually or connected to existing circuits package in Julia e.g. `Circuits.jl`.
- [ ] Create a function for preparing any model before state estimation ... make sure appropriate limits are in place `check_data_model()`
