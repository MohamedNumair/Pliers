# Pliers.jl


This package is a collection of tools that I usually need (like a swiss army knife) for analyzing power distribution systems. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the [PowerModelsDistribution.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModelsDistribution.jl) or [PowerModelsDistributionStateEstimation.jl](https://github.com/Electa-Git/PowerModelsDistributionStateEstimation.jl) packages for simplified reporting, analysis and visualization.

Other relevant Power System Distribution tools and packages can be also supports, e.g., converting different formats into each other. 

The package is still in very early development, so please report any issues you encounter.
